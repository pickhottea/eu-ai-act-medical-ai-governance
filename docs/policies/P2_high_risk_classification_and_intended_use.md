# P2 — High-Risk Classification & Intended Use

## Purpose
Formally classify the AI system as **High-Risk AI** under the EU AI Act
and clearly define its **intended use**, limitations, and non-intended uses.

This policy ensures that system scope is explicit, reviewable,
and aligned with regulatory expectations.

---

## High-Risk Classification

This AI system is classified as **High-Risk AI** pursuant to:

- **EU AI Act Art. 6**
- **Annex III** (Medical and healthcare-related use cases)

The classification applies regardless of whether the system operates
in an autonomous or decision-support capacity.

---

## Intended Use

The system is intended to provide **clinical decision support** only.

Specifically:
- The system produces **risk predictions or alerts**
  to support prioritization, review, or triage workflows.
- Outputs are **advisory** and must be reviewed by qualified professionals.
- The system does **not** perform diagnosis or treatment decisions.

Final clinical responsibility remains with human healthcare professionals.

---

## Explicit Limitations

The system:
- Does **not** operate autonomously
- Does **not** replace clinical judgment
- Does **not** self-update or self-modify
- Does **not** make legally or medically binding decisions

Use of the system outside the defined intended purpose
constitutes **misuse** and is out of scope of this governance framework.

---

## Non-Intended Use (Out of Scope)

The following uses are explicitly excluded:
- Autonomous diagnosis or treatment
- Use in non-medical domains
- Use outside EU regulatory context
- Cross-border data processing beyond EU-only assumptions

---

## Governance Implications

Any material change to:
- intended purpose,
- target population,
- clinical workflow integration, or
- risk profile

**must trigger a governance review**
and may require reclassification or updated documentation.

---

## Relationship to EU AI Act
Supports compliance with:
- **Art. 6** — High-Risk AI classification
- **Art. 9** — Risk management framework
- **Art. 13** — Transparency and intended purpose disclosure

*This policy forms part of the EU AI Act–oriented governance framework
