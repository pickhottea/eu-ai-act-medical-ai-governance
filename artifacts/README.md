# Governance Evidence Artifacts (Placeholder)

This folder contains representative governance evidence artifacts
generated during the execution of the demo notebooks.

Due to sanitization and confidentiality considerations,
only example or placeholder artifacts are publicly shared.

Evidence categories include:
- A-series: dataset structure and lineage snapshots
- C-series: explainability outputs (SHAP, Grad-CAM)
- D-series: audit logs and human oversight records

Full evidence is generated at execution time in a controlled environment.
